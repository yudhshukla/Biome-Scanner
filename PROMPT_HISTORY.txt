This project features one HTML file for the core logic which uses Mapbox and OpenWeatherMap APIs with the help of Gemini Pro.

I want to create a project that uses geographical data (maybe a world map) and maps attributes of certain countries/places to minecraft biomes. And includes chinese! Which APIs are best suited for this? This should be a 2-3 hour AI-guided project.

I want more climates, I feel like 4 is not comprehensive.

The cursor is not showing up as the crosshair, how can I fix this?

The cursor is a pokeball, can we change this? I also want the pop up and image to be much bigger, maybe like a sidebar that opens. And currently, the ocean is processed the same as land, saying that its plains or forests which doesnt make sense.

Now the detection logic is very wrong. It's showing forest in the middle east. Can u first try to develop a foolproof biome detection logic?

Ok this is better. Let's display more information like the weather, sky condition, and elevation. Can we add more biomes? There are some generalzied classifications liek Greeland to be jagged peaks, but I think the overall detection system is good.

Draw from the minecraft biomes list. Also, how can I make all of the attributes bigger?

Is this the most accurate? Im wondering some countries are hardcoded to only have one biome. Is that ok?

Is there any way to get around the fact that when its cold and high elevation, it thinks its jagged peaks like in in taiwan and some african countries.

I think i know how we can deal with the ocean. It correctly detects ocean to be in the 'ocean continent.' so in this case, we should not apply land conditionals, but create a new detection ssytem when continent is 'ocean' and classify into minecrafts ocean biomes. dont worry about the images, ill add those later

Can we include a likely mobs list in the sidebar?

Why does every country show up as ocean now?

Okay, so it looks like we have a ton of biomes in our list, but we are not applying all of them. Without disrupting the robust biome classification system, can we apply more of the biomes we have? Dont add any new biomes to our list-- I found images already. Assume that the images are in the format of images/deeplukewarmocean.png, no spaces all lowercase title. Please replace the image with that, and apply more biomes if possible (dont add any, just classify)

How come all of the ocean elevations are -24m?

Can you outline the necessary steps for making my project into a geoguessr type of biome guessing game with possibly Google streetview? Is this feasible for 5-6 hours?

Is it possible for it to keep searching for a streetview location if one is not found; does that take too many credits?

How would I go about hiding my key if it needs to be in the URL? Also, for each code-related question, only teach me how to do it and do not provide any code

How can I actually load google maps into my website?

Now I need to write the logic for clicking somewhere and possibly getting a streetview. We don't need to display it right now, but I just want to write how to ask for the streetview. Again, don't provide any code, just tell me how I can start doing this

I think the console is saying I'm clicking before the google maps script is done loading and it is not working

It seems to work. I'm going to add HTML and CSS for the streetview container. What skeleton components should I have in my HTML?

I don't think my modal is being unhidden when the streetview is found despite changing the display

I don't understand why those steps are necessary, can you teach it from a beginner Javascript perspective

This is what I have so far for initializing the streetview, how does it look

I've added logic for drawing guessing buttons, populating an array with guesses, and creating alerts if the guess clicked was right or wrong. How does this look

Can you teach me how to change the styling of the buttons so it is the same as the "biomes discovered" stat

The biome in the sidebar appears before the streetview does, so it spoils the answer. Which lines are responsible for this?

Next, I want to add a lives and score component where users get 3 correct tries in a round to guess before the game restarts. I've added some HTMl and javascript for this, how does it look? For the score, I'm using a mutliplier based on the streak and if the biome is new

How would I approach adding a time countdown? Like if I want to give users 15 seconds to answer before it's wrong? No code yet.

I don't want to use alerts for incorrect, correct, and game over. I'd like to use an actual popup instead. I've tried to implement this using the "biome discovery" popup but there's a few bugs

I got rid of the continue button logic since I don't think users should have to keep on pressing that, but I don't see the popup at all now

How do I update my frontend to call my database to put the user in randomly selected locations? Can I have a code skeleton?

Is there a mapbox function that will bring the user to a specific location given coordinates?

I want to add an exit button to get out of the "drop me" state. It seems like when I don't want to be dropped, the timer is still going. I cleared the timer, streak, and closed the display in a quitgame function- is this enough?
