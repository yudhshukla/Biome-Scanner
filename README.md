This website uses Mapbox GL JS for displaying 3d terrains, Mapbox Geocoding API to detect countries and regions, and OpenWeatherAPI for the current temperature/humidity/etc of each geographical location. For Mapbox, I used the satellite-v9 style with the globe projection. map.queryTerrainElevation(lngLat) is used to get the elevation given the longitude and latitude of where the user clicked. The geocoding API is used by giving the longitude and latitude as well and gives back the country and region of the clicked location. The OpenWeatherMap API is used by sending the latitude and longitude and receiving the temperature, humidity, and precipitation. To get my API keys, I signed up Mapbox's website for a public access token and OpenWeatherMap's website for a free key. My keys are in my .env file and are hidden by .gitignore.
